```

> After Cloning the Project, run **flutter pub get** to install the dependencies and remove those highlighted errors.

## Step 3 : Set a Remote to the Original Repo
- if you check remotes of your cloned project , you'll notice that you already have a reference to your Forked Repo named as Origin.
```
#run this command to check remotes of your cloned repo
$ git remote -v
```

- Remotes are references to fetch or pull any recent changes in the original codebase to your copy of project.
